# Matrix-Equation-Solver
This GitHub repository contains a C++ program designed to solve matrix equations.

It offers functionality to read matrix data from external files, validate the input data, and find solutions for the matrix equation, which includes the left-hand side (LHS) matrix, right-hand side (RHS) matrix, and result (RES) matrix. The program also handles missing values in the matrices and generates detailed output to a specified file.

Key Features:

Reads matrix data from external files, ensuring proper formatting.
Validates input matrices for correctness and consistency.
Solves matrix equations by finding missing values in the matrices.
Supports customizable input filenames and output file configuration.
Efficiently handles matrix operations with a focus on error-checking and reporting.
Utilizes C++ features and libraries for robust matrix manipulation.
Feel free to use and modify this code to solve your own matrix equation problems efficiently.
